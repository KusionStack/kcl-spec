# Codelabs

The Kusion Configuration Language (KCL) codelabs provide a guided, hands-on coding experience.

## Write Simple KCL Config

Create a simple workload config with key-value pairs via simple KCL code.

## Write Advanced Config via KCL Schema

Assemble more complex workloads and add-ons through the KCL schema mechanism. Based on this, the collaboration and reuse mechanism are introduced.
